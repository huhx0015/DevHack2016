## Desciption

Emotolize is a mobile and web application that captures images from a live video session and analyzes the session for overall emotion analytics. Emotolize supports video capture from DJI's OSMO camera devices, as well as the standard Android camera.

Using Microsoft's Project Oxford perceptual intelligence Face and Emotion APIs, we can determine the emotional states of people from captured frames from a video session. Some typical use cases for this application would include psychological analysis, speech emotional feedback, crowd perception, etc.
